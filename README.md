# Boom Bikes assignment
A bicycle-sharing system is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made 
available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price. This systems allow people to borrow a bike from a 
"dock" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system.
 Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike.
  The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place.

## General Information
- This assignment is a part of the couse the authors are pursuing at UpGrad in collaboration with IIIT (Banglore)
- In this assignment, we will use EDA to understand how attributes influence the number of bikes rented.
- We are provied with data containing featurs of all the days in the year 2018-2019.  
- Our aim will be to find correlations between these featurs and come up with a linear regression model that can predict the demand of bikes.

## Conclusions
- I have found that the major influence on the sales is from the weather
- A warm wether with clear skys has a positive impact on demand 
- Rain or snow has a negative impact on demand
- Summer is the peak season for bikes .

## Technologies Used
- IDE - Jupyter 
- Base language - Python 3.0
- Libraries in python used:
  * Pandas - version: 1.4.2
  * Matplotlib - version 3.5.1
  * Seaborn - version 0.11.2
  * Plotly - version 5.7
